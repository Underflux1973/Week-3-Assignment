// WEEK 3 REFLECTIONS

// Like last week I have found this assignment immensely challenging. I feel that with the Javascript I get stuck on a particular part of the assignment - typically not too far in, and this then dictates the rest of the project. And because I get stuck on that part, I am then unsure as to whether to even add any more code at that point as I wont be able to test its integrity without solved the bug - I would be glad to hear feedback on this please. There were moments of success which I have alluded to in my notes within the codes, and that felt great to have done that. But overall I can say that I do not feel any level of confidence when writing Javascript.

// Time wise, as I have been trying to work out the Javascript bug with particular reference to writing code for the setInterval, I then ran out of time to complete the CSS elements of grid, flexbox, and other styling.

// I feel very behind with it all and disappointed in this weeks submission if I'm honest, especially given the amount of time that I've spent on this.

//Moving forward, I will revisit the Javascript workshops and commit to looking at some extra resources, and practicing the basics, which I hope will help with me understanding the logic.

//My time management has been appalling this week. I am trying hard not to get sucked into a problem and not asking for help, much earlier. Moving forward here I will ask for help much earlier!
